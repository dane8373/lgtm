# lgtm

We've all wondered - what does LGTM stand for? Who can say. Truly, a mystery.

But now, you'll never need to wonder again; generate your very own LGTMs with this, the world's first LGTMaaS platform. 

Try it for yourself!

```
$ curl lgtm.halsted.space
```

Fresh LGTMs served up piping hot, on demand, as soon as the Heroku free tier dyno spins up. Give it a sec. You think I'm spending money on this?
